$ indicates a command line prompt. Do not copy it when running the following material.

To compile, in the same folder where your .c file is, run the following command

$ make

If successful (i.e. gcc didn't complain) you should now have a file named Assignment_1 (with no file extension). To run/execute it, try the following:

$./Assignment_1

and see what happens. It should fail with an appropriate error message as this assignment requires an input file from the command line

To run it properly, use either of the two options below. In first case, the output will be stored to the file sample_out.txt
while in the second case it will be displayed to the console: 

$./Assignment_1 sample_in.txt > sample_out.txt

OR

$./Assignment_1 sample_in.txt
